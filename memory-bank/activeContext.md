# Active Context: DyzBox

## Current Focus

The DyzBox project is currently in the initial implementation phase. We've established the foundation for the email management client and implemented basic UI components based on the design inspiration. Our immediate priorities are:

1. **UI Component Implementation**: Creating a clean, modern interface for the email client with Next.js and Tailwind.
2. **Gmail API Integration**: Connecting to Gmail to fetch and display real emails.
3. **Authentication Setup**: Implementing user authentication with Gmail using NextAuth.
4. **Email Operations**: Building core email functionality (read, send, reply, forward).

## Recent Decisions

1. **Tech Stack Selection**: Next.js frontend with Tailwind CSS, Supabase (PostgreSQL) backend, Python microservices for AI integration.
2. **AI Provider**: Gemini 2.0 Flash selected as the primary LLM for AI capabilities.
3. **Email Provider Support**: Initial focus on Gmail integration with IMAP/POP3 support planned for later phases.
4. **Privacy Approach**: Commitment to on-device processing where possible, with opt-in for cloud processing.
5. **Repository Setup**: Project initialized with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, and pushed to GitHub at https://github.com/ddavidson99/dyzbox.
6. **UI Structure**: Implemented a three-panel layout with sidebar navigation, email list, and email preview.

## Current Challenges

1. **Gmail API Limitations**: Understanding Gmail API quotas and limitations for email operations.
2. **UI Component Design**: Balancing aesthetics with performance for a fast, responsive interface.
3. **Authentication Flow**: Creating a seamless authentication experience for Gmail users.
4. **Email Data Management**: Efficiently handling email data and synchronization with providers.

## Implementation Strategy

The development approach follows a phased implementation plan:

### Current Phase: Core UI & Gmail Integration (Q1 2025)
- Building clean, modern UI components for email management
- Implementing Gmail authentication and basic email operations
- Creating the foundation for the email client experience
- Setting up the data models and state management for emails

### Next Phase: Enhanced AI Features (Q2 2025)
- Adding AI-powered email categorization and summary capabilities
- Implementing smart reply suggestions
- Enhancing the email organization capabilities
- Developing speed-optimized keyboard navigation

## Next Steps

1. **Gmail Authentication**: Implement NextAuth for Google authentication
2. **Email Fetching**: Connect to Gmail API to fetch and display real emails
3. **Compose Functionality**: Create the email composition interface
4. **Thread View**: Implement email thread/conversation view
5. **Mobile Responsiveness**: Ensure the UI works well on mobile devices

## Open Questions

1. How can we optimize the Gmail API usage to handle large email volumes efficiently?
2. What's the best approach for implementing real-time updates when new emails arrive?
3. How should we structure the data models to support both Gmail and future email providers?
4. What's the optimal caching strategy for email data to ensure speed and offline access?
5. How should we implement the AI processing pipeline for email summarization?

## Current Team Focus

- **Frontend Team**: Implementing UI components and email client interface
- **API Integration**: Connecting to Gmail API and handling authentication
- **UX Team**: Refining the user interface based on design inspiration
- **Backend Planning**: Preparing for server-side components and data storage
