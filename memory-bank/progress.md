## Known Issues and Blockers

1. **API Limitations**: Need to investigate limitations in email provider APIs that may affect feature implementation
2. **AI Performance**: Need to validate performance of on-device AI processing vs. cloud processing
3. **Resource Allocation**: Team resources not yet fully allocated for implementation phase
4. **Third-party Dependencies**: Need to finalize decisions on third-party components and libraries

## Next Milestone

**Target**: Gmail API Integration (End of Q1 2025)

**Deliverables**:
- Authentication with Gmail using NextAuth
- Fetching and displaying real emails from Gmail
