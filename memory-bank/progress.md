## What's Working

1. **Project Requirements**: Comprehensive project brief with clear feature definitions
2. **Market Analysis**: Detailed competitive analysis and market positioning
3. **Technical Direction**: Initial tech stack decisions and architecture approach
4. **Phased Plan**: Clear implementation phases with logical progression

## What's Left to Build

### Core Infrastructure
- Development environment setup
- CI/CD pipeline configuration
- Database schema design and implementation
- Authentication system setup

### Email Client Foundation
- Email provider API integration framework
- Email data model and storage implementation
- Basic email operations (read, send, reply, forward)
- Email synchronization engine

### AI Components
- AI service architecture and integration
- Email classification and categorization system
- Summary generation service
- Reply suggestion system

### User Interface
- Design system implementation
- Core UI components
- High-performance rendering framework
- Keyboard shortcut system

### Cross-Platform Support
- Web application
- Desktop applications (macOS, Windows)
- Mobile applications (iOS, Android)

## Known Issues and Blockers

1. **API Limitations**: Need to investigate limitations in email provider APIs that may affect feature implementation
2. **AI Performance**: Need to validate performance of on-device AI processing vs. cloud processing
3. **Resource Allocation**: Team resources not yet fully allocated for implementation phase
4. **Third-party Dependencies**: Need to finalize decisions on third-party components and libraries

## Next Milestone

**Target**: Architecture and Design Completion (End of Q1 2025)

**Deliverables**:
- Finalized system architecture documentation
- UI/UX design system and key screen mockups
- Technical proof of concepts for critical components
- Development environment and CI/CD setup
- Initial project structure and codebase setup
