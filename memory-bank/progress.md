# Project Progress: DyzBox

## Current Status

DyzBox has been initialized with a Next.js framework using TypeScript and Tailwind CSS. We've implemented the basic UI components for the email client interface based on the design inspiration, resolved configuration issues with Tailwind CSS, and implemented authentication with NextAuth for Gmail integration. We've also improved the application's resilience by enhancing error handling in server actions and API calls, and implemented a modern two-pane email view with resizable panels.
