## Competitive Analysis

## AI Processing Approach

## Current Product Decision Log

1. **UI Layout**: We selected a two-pane resizable layout for the main interface, balancing information density with readability. The email list and content views can be resized by users to suit their preferences.

2. **Authentication Method**: We've implemented OAuth-based authentication with Gmail as the primary identity provider, with plans to add Outlook and other providers. We'll use a provider-based authentication strategy that maintains a single user identity in our system while supporting multiple email accounts.

3. **Email Provider Support**: Our initial focus is on Gmail integration, followed by Outlook. We'll implement a provider-agnostic interface layer to ensure consistent functionality across different email services.

4. **Privacy Approach**: We've committed to a privacy-first architecture that:
   - Processes sensitive data on-device where possible
   - Provides clear opt-in controls for cloud processing
   - Never uses email content for advertising or third-party services
   - Offers transparency about what data is processed and where

5. **Feature Prioritization**: We've prioritized core email functionality and UI experience in Phase 1, with advanced AI features coming in Phase 2. This allows us to deliver a useful product faster while building the foundation for intelligence.

6. **Keyboard Navigation**: We've committed to comprehensive keyboard shortcut support, allowing power users to navigate and process emails without touching the mouse.

7. **Mobile Strategy**: We'll implement a responsive design that adapts the two-pane layout for smaller screens, focusing on a coherent experience across devices rather than separate mobile/desktop experiences.

8. **UI Design Language**: We've selected a clean, minimal design language with purpose-driven colors and ample whitespace to create a calm, focused experience.

9. **Email Organization**: We'll implement Gmail-style labels rather than folders, allowing emails to exist in multiple categories simultaneously.

10. **Sync Strategy**: We'll use a real-time synchronization strategy for email operations, ensuring changes appear immediately across all devices.

11. **Email Content Display**: We've implemented HTML email rendering with sanitization for security, with a plain text fallback option.

12. **Search Implementation**: We'll leverage provider search capabilities where available, with our own index for advanced/offline search features.

13. **Date Formatting**: We've implemented intelligent date formatting that adapts based on the age of emails, showing time for today's emails and date for older ones.
