## Architecture Overview

### Component Architecture
- **Email Client Core**: Handles connection to email providers, synchronization, and basic operations
- **AI Processing Pipeline**: Manages email analysis, categorization, and content generation
- **User Interface Layer**: Provides speed-optimized interface across platforms
- **Data Storage Layer**: Manages user preferences, AI models, and cached data
- **Integration Layer**: Connects with external systems and services

### Data Flow
1. Emails retrieved from provider APIs and stored in local cache
2. AI pipeline processes emails for categorization and summarization
3. UI presents processed data to users with minimal latency
4. User interactions feed back into AI learning system
5. Changes synchronized back to email providers

## Privacy & Security Architecture
