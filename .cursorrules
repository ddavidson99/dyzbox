# DyzBox Project Rules

## Design Patterns

1. **UI Components**
   - Use Phosphor icons consistently throughout the application
   - Apply light gray backgrounds for hover/active states
   - Use blue only as narrow accents, not as full backgrounds
   - Maintain consistent font sizes: text-sm for sidebar, text-base for content
   - Use Tailwind's typography plugin for rich text content

2. **React Patterns**
   - Prefer functional components with hooks
   - Use custom hooks for shared logic
   - Apply useCallback for event handlers
   - Use state management patterns that prevent duplicate operations
   - Apply Suspense boundaries around components using useSearchParams()

3. **Error Handling**
   - Return structured response objects with success/error fields
   - Provide toast notifications for user feedback
   - Use try/catch in all server actions
   - Include error logging for debugging
   - Always provide fallback UI states for errors

4. **API Integration**
   - Use server actions for external API calls
   - Apply appropriate rate limiting and backoff strategies
   - Process API responses before sending to components
   - Handle empty or malformed responses gracefully
   - Use pagination tokens for large data sets

## Coding Style

1. **TypeScript Usage**
   - Use strict typing for all components and functions
   - Create interfaces for complex data structures
   - Apply proper type guards for conditional logic
   - Export types/interfaces when used across files
   - Use explicit return types for functions

2. **Component Structure**
   - Group related state variables together
   - Place helper functions before the main return statement
   - Use useCallback for event handlers passed to children
   - Extract complex logic to custom hooks
   - Keep components focused on a single responsibility

3. **CSS/Tailwind Usage**
   - Use Tailwind utility classes directly in JSX
   - Group related classes (layout, spacing, color, etc.)
   - Apply responsive variants consistently
   - Use consistent color palette from tailwind.config.ts
   - Extract common class combinations to reusable variables

## Project Preferences

1. **File Organization**
   - Place components in feature-based directories
   - Group related components together
   - Keep UI components in `ui` directory
   - Store email-related components in `email` directory
   - Maintain server actions in `app/actions` directory

2. **State Management**
   - Use React Context for global state (animations, theme)
   - Keep component state local when possible
   - Use server actions for API-related operations
   - Apply optimistic updates for better UX
   - Implement proper loading states for async operations

3. **Navigation Patterns**
   - Use Next.js App Router for routing
   - Implement proper client-side navigation
   - Provide loading states during navigation
   - Use dynamic routes for email detail views
   - Apply appropriate session checks for protected routes

## Troubleshooting Patterns

1. **Common Issues**
   - Next.js 15 build issues often related to missing Suspense boundaries
   - React 19 compatibility issues with legacy components using findDOMNode
   - Gmail API rate limits require proper handling (429 responses)
   - Authentication issues often due to incorrect/expired tokens
   - Browser router issues need useSearchParams in Suspense boundaries

2. **Performance Considerations**
   - Batch API requests when possible
   - Implement proper pagination for large data sets
   - Apply debounce for frequent user actions
   - Use memoization for expensive calculations
   - Avoid unnecessary re-renders with useCallback/useMemo

3. **Gmail API Specifics**
   - Ensure proper scopes for OAuth authentication
   - Use labels.get for accurate message counts
   - Implement proper error handling for rate limits
   - Use base64url encoding for email content
   - Format email headers correctly for the API

## Testing and QA

1. **Manual Testing Focus**
   - Test all email operations with different content types
   - Verify draft saving behavior with various content states
   - Check UI consistency across different screen sizes
   - Test authentication flow from sign-in to API operations
   - Verify proper handling of API errors

## Developer Workflow

1. **Git Practices**
   - Use conventional commit messages (feat:, fix:, etc.)
   - Include descriptive messages summarizing changes
   - Keep related changes in single commits
   - Push to main branch after verifying functionality
   - Address linting issues before committing

## Project Intelligence

### Core Project Knowledge
- DyzBox is an AI-powered email management client focused on intelligent organization, speed, and privacy
- Target release date for initial version: Q2 2025
- Roadmap follows 4 phases: Core Experience → Enhanced AI → Team Collaboration → Advanced Personalization
- Primary tech stack: Next.js frontend, Supabase backend, Python microservices for AI processing
- AI powered by Gemini 2.0 Flash with on-device processing capabilities where possible

### User Experience Principles
- Speed is critical - sub-100ms response time for all common actions
- Keyboard-first design with comprehensive shortcut support
- Clean, uncluttered UI that focuses attention on important emails
- Privacy controls must be transparent and user-configurable
- AI should enhance user control, not replace it

## Development Patterns

### Coding Style
- TypeScript for all frontend code with strict typing
- Python for AI services using type hints and Pydantic
- Components follow atomic design methodology
- CSS uses Tailwind with custom design system extension
- File structure follows feature-based organization

### Implementation Priorities
- Performance optimization takes precedence over code elegance
- Privacy-preserving approaches preferred when available
- User control options should exist for all automated features
- Cross-platform consistency is essential

### Architecture Guidelines
- Clear separation between UI, business logic, and data layers
- Provider-agnostic interfaces for email functionality
- Event-driven architecture for real-time updates
- Use adapter pattern for integrating different email providers
- Implement CQRS pattern for optimized read/write operations

## Workflow Preferences

### Project Management
- Features should align with phased implementation plan
- Document architecture decisions with clear rationale
- Create proofs of concept for uncertain technical approaches
- Follow Test-Driven Development for core functionality

### Documentation Standards
- Maintain comprehensive API documentation
- Document UI components in design system
- Keep architecture diagrams updated with implementation
- Include privacy and security considerations in technical docs
